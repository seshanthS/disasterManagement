In the event of a disaster, the government would send food aid. But most of the time ,it gets delayed due to various reasons. 
In the mean time ,the aid can be supplied by local shop owners. We can encourage them to help, by promising them that the government would pay them later. 
In this way ,we can ensure the food to reach on time. 

Blockchain can be used to act as the single source of truth.
The shop keepers, who are ready to help should enroll first. They are issued digital certs to transact in blockchain. 

Barcode is scanned before sending aid to disaster hit region. Thus the amount of help done by an individual is logged, who can be later payed.
